# Gauntlet

BASIC REQUIREMENTS

Our recreation of Gauntlet includes two levels inspired by the original first and second levels from the 1985 arcade version. A variety of audio effects are present throughout the game -- different sounds play upon grabbing treasure, food, keys, taking damage, or firing, as well as when the player clicks buttons on a menu screen. Different Gauntlet-esque music tracks can be heard in the background of the individual levels and on the menu, win, and loss screens.

ART

Both levels feature differently themed backgrounds designed by our artist, as well as a Wizard sprite, magic projectiles, treasure, food, a door, a level exit, ghosts, and ghost spawners. The Wizard sprite animates as the player moves, turning to face whichever direction he is headed. A sparkling gold particle effect appears above keys present in the level.
Our menus are presented in a style similar to the original game, mimicing flashing arcade screens to draw player attention.

CODE

The game's controls are WASD to move, space to shoot, ESC to pause, and left shift to quit. The player is also able to move and shoot diagonally.
The player is able to fire projectiles to damage enemies, unlock doors, and collect treasure, food, and keys throughout the levels. The code also includes an enemy AI which causes the game's ghosts to follow and attack the player after spawning.

TECH

The game's levels are modeled after the first and second levels from 1985's Gauntlet, both of which are completely enclosed by a thick outer wall the player cannot pass through. 
The main menu, about, win, and loss screens are all formatted similarly to the idle screens featured in the original Gauntlet arcade cabinet. 

OTHER ELEMENTS

Our team decided to keep the original Gauntlet's 8-bit style and designed our assets accordingly. Enemies behave very similarly to the original as well, tracking the player throughout the map from their spawn points until destroyed. To keep the game short, we opted to rearrange enemy spawner, food, and exit locations, though the levels remain familiar to anyone who has played the game's predecessor.
